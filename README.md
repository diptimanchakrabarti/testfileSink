# iDaaS-Route
iDaaS Route Repository to provide a consistent place for all relevant assets for iDaaS Routing and Data Distribution.

Below please find a visual that does visualize the entire iDaaS capabilities set.
The key thing to note is while each specific iDaaS capability is purpose built and designed
for any type of customer public or hybrid cloud our focus is on meeting data where it is securely  
and at scale.

# Pre-Requisites
For capability and design patterns they are established to work with AMQ-Streams
out of the box, so you will need to have this setup and running. You will notice a Kafka Windows link, this is based on the upstream
Apache Kafka release.

[Kafka](Kafka.md)
[KafkaWindows](KafkaWindows.md)

We also leverage [Kafka Tools](https://kafkatool.com/) to help us show Kafka details and transactions..
